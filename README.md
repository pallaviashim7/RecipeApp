### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

* Initial system design - List down important modules, features that is required. Helped me decide on estimation.
* Unit testing - Used previews while developing inorder to capture errors in the initial state
* Dependency Injection - Importantly added for unit testing
* Structuring of project - Very important when comes to bigger applications when many teams work together

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
* 4-5 hours 
* Made the UI layer first with mock data
* Made the backend/Network layer and connected.
* Added UI tests

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
* I firmly believes that having dedicated models will help in decoupling the UI layer for network layer . For simplicity of the project i have not used that approach.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
* UI design - adopted the bare minimum
* Network error handling - Just looking for response data and not the response code.
* Device support. Havent tested on all oriendation and devices

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
Changing libraries and methods in SwiftUI made me a little slower.
